 * CompositeKeyComparator

 * Purpose: Compares two WriteableComparables
 * 
 * When we are sorting keys, in this case we only want to sort by group ids in
 * that we want all of the same group ids grouped together regardless of the
 * timestamp portion of their key. This functionality is provided by the
 * NaturalKeyGroupingComparator class
 * 
 * Inside the set of k/v pairs in this group, in this secondary sort example we
 * want to sort on the second half of the key (TimeseriesKey) which is the
 * purpose of this class.
